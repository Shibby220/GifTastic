This is an application that has buttons that will bring up gifs of certain animals when you click on them.

Each time you click on a button for a certain animal it will grab 10 gifs relating to that animal from Giphy along with their rating.

If you type the name of an animal in the search box and click "Add Animal" it will add a button for that animal as well.

When the gifs first load they will all be still images but when you click on each one it will animate. 

Once the gif is animated clicking the gif again will turn it back into a still image.
